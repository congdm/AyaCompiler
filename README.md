# AyaCompiler

## Description

This compiler is based on the Oberon-0 compiler in Prof. Niklaus Wirth "Compiler Construction" book.

The goal is to implement the recursive descent compiler for Oberon-07 language, Intel 64 architecture.

Written in Component Pascal, compiled by Gardens Point Component Pascal, and the generated output of this compiler is FASM-syntax assembly code.

Binary is also supply with source. At current stage, the compiler can build some simple Win64 program, without import/export abilities and some language constructions is still missing.
