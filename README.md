# Patchouli Oberon-07 Compiler

## Description

This compiler is based on Prof. Niklaus Wirth "Compiler Construction" book and the Oberon-07 compiler in Project Oberon (2013).

The goal is to implement a recursive descent compiler for Oberon-07 language, Intel 64 architecture.

Previously named AyaCompiler, which was a single pass compiler. However, since the current version (which employs a syntax tree) is considerably different from the old one, I decide to change its name.

Binary is also supply with source.

## Documentation

This compiler follows the latest [Oberon-07 Report](http://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/Oberon/Oberon07.Report.pdf) faithfully (hope so).

Compiler-specific features are documented in: [Detailed Documentation](https://github.com/congdm/Patchouli-Compiler/wiki/Detailed-Documentation)

On the inner working of compiler: [Compiler Construction](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/CompilerConstruction/index.html) and [Project Oberon 2013](https://www.inf.ethz.ch/personal/wirth/ProjectOberon/index.html) are pretty sufficient.
